<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Haishuai Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/haishuaiwang), with the [EAGLE Lab](http://eagle.zju.edu.cn/) led by [Prof. Jiajun Bu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/bjj). I am also a visiting student at the Hangzhou Institute of Medicine, China Academy of Sciences. I am delighted to collaborate closely with [Prof. Hong-Ning Dai](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~henrydai/). I received my master's degree from the College of Computer and Data Science, Fuzhou University, under the guidance of [Prof. Shiping Wang](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/8958.htm) and [Dr. Zhaoliang Chen](https://chenzl23.github.io/). During my master's studies, I was also a visiting student at the School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, fortunately advised by [Prof. Jicong Fan](https://jicongfan.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my B.E. in Computer Science at the College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, in 2021. I have published papers in several prestigious conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, ACM MM, IEEE TKDE, TIP, TNNLS, TMM, Information Fusion, and Pattern Recognition, etc. My recent research interests focus on graph-based machine learning and AI4Science. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDlGhPsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fzhihaowu99%2Fzhihaowu99.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
